# Horse Racing App - README

### Introduction
Welcome to the Horse Racing App repository! This project aims to provide horse racing enthusiasts with a comprehensive platform for accessing horse racing data, live race updates, statistics, and much more. The app leverages an external API to fetch horse racing data and utilizes Axios for seamless data retrieval.

## Challenges Faced
One of the major challenges encountered during the development of this app was the utilization of an API that had limitations on the number of requests allowed. After reaching the limit of 40 requests, the API would expire, leading to disruptions in data fetching. This limitation posed a significant hurdle and highlighted the importance of selecting reliable APIs with sufficient request limits in future projects.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
